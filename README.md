# Codeigniter and Doctrine

This is my initial project-setup for Codeigniter and Doctrine.
The Doctrine library is located in `system/library/doctrine`.

### Versions
* [Codeigniter](http://codeigniter.com/) -- 1.7.2
* [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) -- 1.2.3

### Doctrine command line interface
The Doctrine_Cli is located in the application/ folder
	cd application
	doctrine

On windows systems you'll have to type `php doctrine`
